# sciringe
 Simple script to generate ghost VBS process for .BAT & other scrips

Nothing very special here, just making some exercise

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* **a computer** - *obviously*
* **a Windows OS** - *On some situations, your own computer is a luxury*

### Installing

Nothing to install, this is a portable version using Windows *temporary folder*

Step 1:

```
Run the sciringe.exe
```

Step 2:

```
Follow Instructions
```

## Running the tests

You can use the attached *test.bat* to try the script
this one is supposed to creat a ".txt" file named *TCPinfo* inside a folder name *NetworkLog*

Try to run the *test.bat* alone and notice the visual notifications

Then use it over the *sciringe* script
